# package-builders

As a pkgsrc developer, I want to make sure all my packages work on a wide variety of platforms.

As a server administrator, I want to update every week to a fresh-built set of the latest packages.

## In this repository

- VM run scripts for platforms I'm trying to care about
- Automation for rebuilding and updating my server's packages
- Partial automation for bringing up my preferred pkgsrc dev environment
