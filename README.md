# README: Amitai's Package Rebuild

I run a personal server.

Since it runs NetBSD, it's generally pretty boring.

Since I depend on a lot of third-party software (mail, web, database, DNS, etc.), it's always at risk of suddenly getting interesting.

To mitigate the risk, I upgrade all that third-party software approximately once a week.

To mitigate the risk of that going poorly, I can always roll back to last week's.

To mitigate the tedium, I automate as much as possible.

This is the automation.
